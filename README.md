# Test Task Solution

## Bulding script

- source files are in `client/`
- `index.html` and `main.css` are only used for test purposes
- `main.js` uses modules from `client/scripts`
- to make the `bundle.js` run `npm run bundle` in the terminal. The build/client/`bundle.js` will be generated.

## Starting server

- use `npm start` command to build and start the server
- `npm run dev` command could be used to the start server in development mode
